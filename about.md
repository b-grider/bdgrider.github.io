My name is Ben Grider. I was born in Florida, raised in Florida, and I'm currently in school at the University of Florida. I like adventures in the great outdoors, strong cups of black coffee, solving hard problems, and the feeling of bettering yourself and others. If you say “bless you” when your dog sneezes we will probably get along exceedingly well.

I initially designed this website from scratch using barebones HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I quickly realized how inefficient this was compared to existing tools like [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) for dealing with web blogs/light content management, so I switched over to Jekyll. Writing blog posts in markdown gives me the efficiency of using a word processor while offering the option of including any html tag styled in any way. This makes Jekyll a perfect fit for the job of a lightweight content management system for the technically savvy, in my opinion. I also love the flexibility jekyll offers in terms of design and customizability. I had a lot of fun adding the stylistic touches to this site, all of which were implemented by me personally (inlcuding the photos, photography has been a recent hobby of mine).
