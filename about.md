I initially designed this website from scratch using barebones HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I quickly realized how inefficient this was compared to existing tools like [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) for dealing with web blogs/light content management, so I switched over to Jekyll. Writing blog posts in markdown gives me the efficiency of using a word processor while offering the option of including any html tag styled in any way. This makes Jekyll a perfect fit for the job of a lightweight content management system, in my opinion. I also loved the flexibility jekyll offered in terms of design and customizability. All stylistic touches on this website were implemented by me personally (inlcuding the photos, photography has been a recent hobby of mine).
